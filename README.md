Trend Report
============

This is our Lighthouse Labs final project. It will be an application that scrapes certain blogs and websites and provides a central dynamic “Trend Report” for different categories including fashion, food and books. A user can sign up for an account and save his or her favourite articles.

Trend Report is still in its initial stages of development, and our focus is currently on providing a fashion trend report. The next phase will be to implement additional categories. It will be created using the following stack: Ruby on Rails, Postgres and React.js.
